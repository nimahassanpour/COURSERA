# COURSERA

This repository contains the courses I have taken from Coursea to learn Machine Learning and Deep neural network.

Based on [Coursera Terms and Conditions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/supplement/muGtL/deep-learning-honor-code) I am not allowed to upload my codes and projects on Github. Therefore this repository only gives the outline content of what I have done for the following courses.
